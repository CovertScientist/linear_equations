# linear_equations

#This program solves a system of equations for any number of unknown varaibles,
#as long as there are the same number of equations as there are variables.

#The equations have to be formated like this: ax +by +cz +... =d
#There has to be one space between each termand each term must be connected to the
#+ or = in front of it.
#If you want to write 'ax -by =c', you have to write 'ax +-by =c'
